# Machine_Learning_Red_Wine

Using Machine Learning, 4 different models have been completed to find the one that best one that predicts the level of alcohol of the wine taking into account different variables:

    1. Linear Regression
    2. Decision Tree
    3. Random Forest
    4. XGBoost

### RESULT

From the different models that have been completed, it has been seen that the XGBoost is the best one.From the result,it can be said that XGBoost provides a considerable good enough. # However, it does not provide a definitive answer
