# Red Wine: Alcohol percentage prediction

**I like a good red wine :wine_glass:!**                  

Hence, reason I have enjoyed it a little bit extra the completion of this exercise.

Using Machine Learning, 4 different models have been completed to find the best model that predicts the percentage of alcohol of the red wine.

### Used Machine Learning Models: 

    1. Linear Regression
    2. Decision Tree
    3. Random Forest
    4. XGBoost

### RESULT

From the different models that have been completed, it has been seen that the **XGBoost method** is the best one to predict the percentage of alcohol of the red wine. From the result, it can be said that XGBoost provides a considerable good enough model. However, it does not provide a definitive answer.
